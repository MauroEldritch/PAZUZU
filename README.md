# PAZUZU: Portainer Authentication Zap Using Zero Utilities

Pazuzu is a ruby exploit for vulnerable Portainer instances (those running with the --no-auth switch by default.
When tested, Pazuzu found 300+ vulnerable containers among many instances. All of them hosted government related information, and are already patched. It is named after the main antagonist on The Exorcist.

PAZUZU was featured @ DevFest Siberia 2018 by its original author (Mauro CÃ¡seres / Mauro Eldritch).
```
#Run with STARTING_IP and ENDING_IP as arguments:

./pazuzu.rb 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.10
```

When running on daemon mode (-d) [yeah, I said daemon, really original], PAZUZU will spawn a local vulnerable instance for testing purposes.
```
#Get a local vulnerable instance

./pazuzu.rb -d
```

Pazuzu comes bundled with Exorcist (Previously, Karras), a special tool meant to destroy Pazuzu's devilish containers. Invoke it to safely get rid of them and clean your system. It is the only recommended way, as it cleans the messy volumes used by Portainer.
```
#Back to hell!

./exorcist.rb
```
